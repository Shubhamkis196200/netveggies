      <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8; color: var(--text-light); margin-bottom: 2em;">Hi! I'm so glad you're here. NetVeggies started as a personal project — a way to document my own journey into plant-based cooking — and has grown into something I never expected: a community of people who believe that eating more plants shouldn't be complicated, expensive, or boring.</p>

      <h2>The NetVeggies Story</h2>
      <p>Three years ago, I decided to try eating more plant-based meals. Not for any dramatic reason — no health crisis, no documentary that changed my life overnight. I was simply curious. Could I make delicious food without relying on meat and dairy? Could I do it on a budget that made sense for my life? Could I actually enjoy it?</p>

      <p>The answer, as it turned out, was yes. But it took time, experimentation, and a lot of trial and error. I burned tofu. I made bland lentil soup. I spent way too much money on specialty ingredients that sat in my pantry unused. And then, slowly, things started clicking. I learned which simple ingredients created big flavor. I discovered that you don't need exotic superfoods to make incredible plant-based meals. I realized that the best vegan recipes are the ones that don't require you to shop at three different stores.</p>

      <p>NetVeggies is the resource I wish I'd had when I started. Every recipe here is designed to be:</p>

      <ul style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; margin: 2em 0;">
        <li><strong>Actually easy</strong> — No complicated techniques or hard-to-find ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Budget-friendly</strong> — Most recipes cost under $2 per serving.</li>
        <li><strong>Beginner-approved</strong> — Clear instructions, helpful tips, and substitution suggestions.</li>
        <li><strong>Tested and retested</strong> — Every recipe has been made multiple times to ensure it works.</li>
        <li><strong>Delicious first, healthy second</strong> — These are recipes you'll actually want to eat, not recipes you'll force yourself to eat because they're "good for you."</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What We Believe</h2>
      <p><strong>Plant-based eating should be accessible to everyone.</strong> You shouldn't need a huge grocery budget, a fully-stocked spice cabinet, or a nutrition degree to eat well. Good food is a right, not a privilege.</p>

      <p><strong>Vegan food is not a compromise.</strong> It's not "almost as good as the real thing." When done right, plant-based food is vibrant, satisfying, and crave-worthy in its own right.</p>

      <p><strong>Perfection is overrated.</strong> You don't have to be 100% vegan to make a difference. Eating more plants — even just a few meals a week — is worth celebrating.</p>

      <p><strong>Cooking should be joyful, not stressful.</strong> Our recipes are designed to fit into real life. Busy weeknights, tight budgets, picky eaters — we get it, and we're here to help.</p>
