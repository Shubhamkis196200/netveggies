      <div class="recipe-card-img" style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f6d365 0%, #fda085 100%); height: 400px; border-radius: var(--radius); display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; font-size: 6rem; margin-bottom: 32px;">🍛</div>

      <p>If there's one recipe that single-handedly converted me to plant-based eating, it's this easy chickpea curry. I first threw it together on a Tuesday night when the fridge was almost empty — a couple of cans of chickpeas, some coconut milk, a jar of curry powder that had been sitting in the back of the spice cabinet. What came out of that pot was so unexpectedly delicious that I've been making variations of it every single week since.</p>

      <p>This is the kind of recipe that makes vegan cooking feel effortless. One pot. Thirty minutes. Ingredients you probably already have in your pantry. And the cost? About $7 total for four generous servings — that's $1.80 per serving, or roughly what you'd pay for a single granola bar at a gas station. Except this is a full, warming, protein-packed meal.</p>

      <p>Whether you're a seasoned vegan, a curious beginner, or just someone who wants an easy weeknight dinner that happens to be plant-based, this chickpea curry delivers. It's creamy from the coconut milk, warmly spiced (but not too spicy — we'll talk about customizing the heat), and the chickpeas give it a satisfying, hearty texture that'll keep you full for hours.</p>

      <h2>Why You'll Love This Chickpea Curry</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>One pot, 30 minutes:</strong> Minimal dishes, minimal effort, maximum flavor. This is truly a dump-and-simmer situation.</li>
        <li><strong>Pantry-friendly:</strong> Almost everything comes from cans and your spice rack. No specialty ingredients required.</li>
        <li><strong>Budget-friendly:</strong> At $1.80 per serving, this is cheaper than fast food and infinitely more nutritious.</li>
        <li><strong>Naturally gluten-free:</strong> No flour, no gluten-containing ingredients. Safe for celiac and gluten-sensitive diners.</li>
        <li><strong>High in protein and fiber:</strong> Chickpeas pack 14g of protein and 10g of fiber per serving — keeping you satisfied.</li>
        <li><strong>Freezer-friendly:</strong> Make a double batch on Sunday and freeze portions for easy weeknight meals all month.</li>
        <li><strong>Kid-approved:</strong> The coconut milk makes it mild and creamy. Even picky eaters tend to love this one.</li>
        <li><strong>Meal-prep perfect:</strong> Tastes even better the next day as the flavors develop overnight.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Key Ingredients and What They Do</h2>

      <p>Let's walk through the ingredient list so you understand the role each one plays — and what you can swap if needed:</p>

      <p><strong>Chickpeas (2 cans):</strong> The protein-packed star of the show. Canned chickpeas are perfectly fine — just drain and rinse them. If you prefer dried chickpeas, soak them overnight and cook until tender before adding to the curry. One can of chickpeas equals roughly 1½ cups cooked.</p>

      <p><strong>Full-fat coconut milk (1 can):</strong> This is what makes the curry creamy and rich. I strongly recommend full-fat here — light coconut milk will make the sauce thinner and less satisfying. If you're avoiding coconut, you can substitute with cashew cream or a plant-based heavy cream.</p>

      <p><strong>Diced tomatoes (1 can):</strong> Adds acidity and depth. Fire-roasted diced tomatoes work beautifully if you can find them — they add a subtle smokiness. You can also use crushed tomatoes for a smoother sauce.</p>

      <p><strong>Curry powder:</strong> A good curry powder is the backbone of this dish. I use a standard Madras-style curry powder from the grocery store. If you want to go the extra mile, toast whole cumin seeds, coriander, and mustard seeds in the oil before adding the onion.</p>

      <p><strong>Coconut oil or olive oil:</strong> Either works. Coconut oil adds a subtle sweetness that complements the curry beautifully. Olive oil keeps things more neutral.</p>

      <p><strong>Fresh spinach:</strong> Stirred in at the end for color, nutrition, and a mild vegetal note. You can substitute kale (cook a bit longer) or skip greens altogether.</p>

      <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

      <h3>Step 1: Sauté the aromatics</h3>
      <p>Heat your oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it's soft and translucent. You want the onion to be fully softened but not browned — this creates a sweet, mellow base for the curry.</p>

      <p>Add the minced garlic and grated ginger, and stir for about 1 minute. You'll know it's ready when your kitchen smells incredible. Be careful not to burn the garlic — it goes from fragrant to bitter in seconds.</p>

      <h3>Step 2: Toast the spices</h3>
      <p>Add the curry powder, cumin, turmeric, and cayenne pepper to the pot. Stir everything together and cook for 30 seconds. Toasting the spices in the oil "blooms" them, releasing their essential oils and deepening the flavor. This one small step makes a huge difference in the final taste.</p>

      <h3>Step 3: Add the liquids</h3>
      <p>Pour in the can of diced tomatoes and the coconut milk. Stir to combine everything into a smooth, golden sauce. Scrape up any spices that may have stuck to the bottom of the pot — those are flavor gold.</p>

      <h3>Step 4: Simmer with chickpeas</h3>
      <p>Add the drained chickpeas and bring the whole thing to a gentle simmer. Let it cook for 15–20 minutes, stirring occasionally. The sauce will thicken as it reduces, and the chickpeas will absorb some of that gorgeous curry flavor. If the sauce gets too thick, add a splash of water or vegetable broth.</p>

      <h3>Step 5: Finish and serve</h3>
      <p>Stir in the fresh spinach and let it wilt — this takes about 1 minute. Season generously with salt and pepper. Taste and adjust: need more heat? Add cayenne. More tang? A squeeze of lemon juice works wonders. More richness? Stir in another spoonful of coconut milk.</p>

      <p>Serve over fluffy basmati rice, with fresh cilantro on top and warm naan bread on the side. A squeeze of lime and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes make beautiful finishing touches.</p>

      <h2>Tips, Variations, and Substitutions</h2>

      <p><strong>Make it spicier:</strong> Add a diced fresh jalapeño with the onion, increase the cayenne to 1 teaspoon, or add a tablespoon of red curry paste.</p>

      <p><strong>Make it creamier:</strong> Stir in 2 tablespoons of cashew butter or peanut butter at the end. It sounds unusual but adds incredible richness.</p>

      <p><strong>Add more vegetables:</strong> Sweet potato (cubed, added with the chickpeas), cauliflower florets, or diced bell pepper all work beautifully.</p>

      <p><strong>Nut-free version:</strong> This recipe is already nut-free as written. If substituting coconut milk, use soy cream or oat cream instead of cashew cream.</p>

      <p><strong>Soy-free version:</strong> Also naturally soy-free as written. Just check your curry powder doesn't contain any soy-based additives.</p>

      <p><strong>Add protein:</strong> Crumble in extra-firm tofu, add cooked lentils, or toss in a handful of raw cashews for extra nutrition and crunch.</p>

      <h2>Storage and Reheating</h2>

      <p><strong>Refrigerator:</strong> Store in an airtight container for up to 5 days. The flavor actually improves overnight as the spices meld.</p>

      <p><strong>Freezer:</strong> Freeze in individual portions for up to 3 months. Let cool completely before transferring to freezer-safe containers. Leave a little headspace for expansion.</p>

      <p><strong>Reheating:</strong> Stovetop is best — warm over medium-low heat, adding a splash of water or coconut milk to loosen the sauce. Microwave works in a pinch: heat in 90-second intervals, stirring between each.</p>

      <p><strong>Meal prep tip:</strong> Cook a big batch on Sunday. Portion into containers with rice and a handful of greens. You've got lunch sorted for the entire work week.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What can I serve with chickpea curry?</h3>
